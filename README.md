I wasn't too fond of the Edge new tab page due to limited customization. 
So I made my own
With transluscent link cards, a quick notes section, and a video background, this page is exactly what I wanted :)

##How to use it
Download the files from the GitHub repo, select a video background you wish to set and add it to `path-to-extension-folder/videos/<video>.mp4`
Then go to Edge Extensions, turn on developer mode, select "Load Unpacked", and navigate to the directory of the extension
Then, youre good to go :)))
